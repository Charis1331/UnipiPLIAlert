# UnipiPLIAlert

### A simple emergency app that handled an emergency that may happen to the user.

Using Android's native TTS engine, device's sensors, Android services and Google's Fused location provider, it achieves:
* Precise user location
* Detects user fall or/and significant light changes
* Notification of (maximum 2) user favorite's contacts in case of an emergency, via SMS
* User notification via the TTS engine and beeping noises

The app was developed as part of my University's curicculum course, "Software Technology".
